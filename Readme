Summary of Tasks Completed in the Data Science Intern Assignment

Data Overview:
Analyzed an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv.
Each file contained relevant information about customers, products, and transaction details.

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to understand the structure and content of the datasets.
Identified key patterns and trends within the data.
Derived at least five business insights based on the analysis, highlighting customer behavior and product performance.
Delivered a Jupyter Notebook containing EDA code and a PDF report summarizing the insights.

Task 2: Lookalike Model:
Built a Lookalike Model that takes user information as input to recommend three similar customers based on their profiles and transaction histories.
Utilized both customer and product information for generating recommendations.
Assigned similarity scores to each recommended customer.
Created a Lookalike.csv file mapping CustomerIDs to their top three lookalikes along with similarity scores for the first 20 customers (C0001 to C0020).
Documented the model development process in a Jupyter Notebook.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering:
Performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques, incorporating both profile information from Customers.csv and transaction data from Transactions.csv.
Chose an appropriate clustering algorithm and determined the number of clusters (4 clusters were formed).
Calculated clustering metrics, including the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index), to evaluate cluster quality.
Visualized clusters using scatter plots to illustrate customer segments based on spending behavior and transaction frequency.
Prepared a report detailing clustering results, including the number of clusters formed, DB Index value, and other relevant metrics.

Final Deliverables:
Uploaded all files to a public GitHub repository following the specified naming conventions for easy access and evaluation.
